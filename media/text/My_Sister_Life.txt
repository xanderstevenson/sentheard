    It is not seemly to be famous

    Celebrity does not exalt;
    There is no need to hoard your writings
    And to preserve them in a vault.

    To give your all - this is creation,
    And not - to deafen and eclipse.
    How shameful, when you have no meaning,
    To be on everybody's lips!

    Try not to live as a pretender,
    But so to manage your affairs
    That you are loved by wide expanses,
    And hear the call of future years.

    Leave blanks in life, not in your papers,
    And do not ever hesitate
    To pencil out whole chunks, whole chapters
    Of your existence, of your fate.

    Into obscurity retiring
    Try your development to hide,
    As autumn mist on early mornings
    Conceals the dreaming countryside.

    Another, step by step, will follow
    The living imprint of your feet;
    But you yourself must not distinguish
    Your victory from your defeat.

    And never for a single moment
    Betray your credo or pretend,
    But be alive-this only matters-

    Alive and burning to the end.
    — Boris Pasternak, My Sister Life
